# hdhr-vintage

A Windows WPF application to use obsolete versions of the SiliconDust HDHomeRun to watch live TV on your computer.

This app acts as a user interface layer for SiliconDust's own hdhomerun_config.exe and VLC. 
Both of these applications need to be installed by the end user before using this app. 
hdhomerun_config.exe is typically installed with the HDHomeRun Software package available on SiliconDust's website.

This app has only been tested using the HDHR-US (rev2), because that is what I own and use. 
Contributions from those with other hardware versions will be welcomed once the app hits a stable release.
